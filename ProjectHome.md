**You can see an example of an experiment [here](http://spellout.net/ibexexps/example/example/experiment.html).**

**I'm now providing free hosting for Ibex (0.3) experiments over at the [Ibex Farm](http://spellout.net/ibexfarm).**

This software allows self-paced reading and speeded acceptability judgment tasks to be run online through a web browser. The server is written in Python and stores results in a CSV file, suitable for later analysis using R, Matlab, etc.

The 0.3 betas should be used in preference to the 0.2.x releases, since they are easier to deploy and less buggy. For version 0.3, the software has been renamed to "Ibex" ("Internet Based EXperiments"). Documentation for this release is at [Documentation03](Documentation03.md), and in PDF form [here](http://spellout.net/latest_ibex_manual.pdf).

The code is developed in a [git repository](http://github.com/addrummond/ibex) (see [Source](Source.md)).
